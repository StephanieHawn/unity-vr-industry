VR Therapy in the Mental Health industry. Unity mobile app project for Udacity's VRND course - Project 5.

### Virtual Reality Mental Health Threapy
VR is taking off in the film and gaming industries, but it has many applications in the medical field. Virtual Reality Therapy is helping patients around the world to relieve mental health conditions like PTSD, Alzheimer's, and Social Anxiety.

After conducting research, I created a mobile virtual reality experience built for Google Cardboard with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users.
